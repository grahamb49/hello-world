Hi,
I'm an experienced analyst who completed an MSc in computing back in 2014 and am currently moving into datascience. I've been busy the last few months working on population models in R, moving my work from Excel (ugh, macros and copy-paste!) into R. I'm learning what GitHub can add to my toolbox.
